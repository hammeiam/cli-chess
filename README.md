== CLI-Chess
A pure Ruby implementation of human v human chess in the command line

Instructions: 
* Download this folder and cd into it
* gem install colorize
* In your terminal, run 'ruby game.rb'
* You'll probably need to increase the text size once the game starts
* Enter the starting and final destination for your move and hit enter (eg 'd2 d4')

The game will validate moves, alert you once the game has ended or when you're in check, and will keep track of each player's time and captured pieces. 
The game will also rotate the board with each turn, so that each player is always closest to his or her side of the board.

Enjoy!
